  transcript: `In this presentation, I want to discuss the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence on modern business. 

First, let's understand what AI really means in today's context. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a theoretical concept - it's actively reshaping how companies operate.

The key benefits are clear: increased efficiency, better decision-making, and automation of repetitive tasks. Companies using AI see a 30-40% improvement in productivity.

Looking at real examples: ChatGPT has reached 100 million users, Tesla's autonomous features are advancing daily, and healthcare AI is diagnosing diseases earlier than humans.

However, we must address challenges: data privacy concerns, the need for skilled professionals, and ethical implications.

In conclusion, AI adoption is not optional anymore - it's a competitive necessity. Organizations need to start their AI journey now or risk falling behind.`,
